The goal of this project is to classify performance metrics and system objectives for a three-
axis CubeSat Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS). The system will be evaluated
through a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed mounted on a three-degree-of-freedom air bearing
representative of space conditions.
